This is an assignment for the Artificial Intelligence class of fall semester of 2021. And the MLP here is going to be mainly used to recognize alphabet carachter but also can be set up for other contexts.

A multilayer perceptron (MLP) is a class of feedforward artificial neural network (ANN). 
An MLP consists of at least three layers of nodes: an input layer, a hidden layer and an output layer. Except for the input nodes, each node is a neuron that uses a nonlinear activation function. MLP utilizes a supervised learning technique called backpropagation for training. Its multiple layers and non-linear activation distinguish MLP from a linear perceptron. It can distinguish data that is not linearly separable.
